# Neural Architecture Search Examples
>[!NOTE]
>These examples assume:
>1. You already have access to an active GCP account
>2. You have a billing enabled on GCP
>3. You have enabled the necessary services (e.g. Vertex API, TPU API, etc)
>4. You understand how to use service accounts, and provide them with the necessary privileges 

1. Using Neural Architecture Search using Dynamic Workload Scheduler to avoid having GPU stockout issues in Vertex. In the [dws_changes](https://github.com/ProshantaSaha/GoogleCloud/tree/main/neural-arch-search) folder, I show the necessary changes for using DWS.
